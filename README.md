### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
<!-- description-start -->
I'm Edmund

Full stack engineer at an AI startup based on the [CAMEL paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17760), proposer of multi-agent systems to divide and conquer complex tasks that foundation models(GPT4/Llama2) can't solve alone.

My ultimate goal is to use artificial intelligence to close the global education gap.
Regardless of the circumstances of your birth, everyone deserves the ability to gain world-class knowledge.
We claim ourselves to be in the information age, yet the internet is the center of both accidental and purposeful misinformation.
The future of knowledge transfer is in agents.
